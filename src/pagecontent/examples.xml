                     <p>This scenario shows the processing of a lab order that is appended to an existing
                        order. In this scenario, a new task is generated for the fulfillment of the appended
                        order, and the lab handles that task accordingly.

                     <p>This scenario demonstrates the process of getting the relevant medication instructions
                        for a patient visit and reporting the results of administration. The scenario is as
                        follows: After the prescription is issued, the institution schedules each individual
                        administration event in the Medication Administration Record (MAR). When preparing
                        for a visit, the nurse queries the MAR for the scheduled administrations, obtaining
                        a bundle of records. The nurse then performs the care activities and registers the
                        results in the device. Upon synchronization of the device and the institution, the
                        results of administration are uploaded to the EHR, thus updating the MAR.
